# Pythagorean program

## 2016-01-11

#### Success
I succeeded creating a program using the pythagorean theorem and a while loop.

#### Failure
I failed to make a program that has no errors when the user types something like '!' or '?'.

#### Question
1. Why does an error message pop up if I type '!' or '?' in my program as the input value?
